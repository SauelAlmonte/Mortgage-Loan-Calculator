/*
    Class: Mortgage

    Programmer's Note:
        - Provides an abstraction for modeling and calculating fixed-rate mortgage data.
        - Encapsulates loan parameters, amortization logic, and output capabilities.
        - Promotes data integrity and computational accuracy.

    Simpler Terms:
        This class helps calculate your monthly home loan payments,
        the total cost of the loan, and can also generate a
        full monthly payment schedule in a text file.

        Programmer's Note:
            - Stores loan details: principal amount, interest rates, and repayment terms.
            - Supports amortization calculations.

        Simpler Terms:
            Info about the loan: how much you borrowed, the interest rate, and how long youâ€™ll take to repay.

        Constructor & Destructor

        Programmer's Note:
            - Handles the lifecycle of the Mortgage object.
            - Logs creation and destruction for traceability.

        Simpler Terms:
            When you start a loan, the constructor sets it up.
            When you're done, the destructor show's a message that the loan object is cleaned up.

        Setter Methods for Core Loan Data

        Programmer's Note:
            - Interfaces to set or update loan parameters.
            - Maintains encapsulation and data integrity.

        Simpler Terms:
            Functions to enter or update the loan amount,
            interest rate, and repayment duration in years.

        Financial Calculation Methods

        Programmer's Note:
            - Computes financial outputs dynamically,
              such as monthly payments and total payback.
            - Marked [[nodiscard]] to warn if the return value is ignored,
              helping prevent accidental misuse of critical financial data.

        Simpler Terms:
            Calculates how much you pay monthly
            and the total repayment amount over the loan term.
            The compiler will warn you if you ignore the results.

        Export Detailed Payment Schedule (Extra Credit)

        Programmer's Note:
            - Creates a detailed amortization schedule,
              writing payment breakdowns to a specified text file.

        Simpler Terms:
            Saves a full payment plan to a file,
            showing how each payment splits into interest, principal, and remaining balance.
