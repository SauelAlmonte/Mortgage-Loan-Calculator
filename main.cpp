    Lab         : 13a â€“ Mortgage
    Program     : Mortgage Loan Calculator

    Description:
        This program calculates the monthly payment and total repayment amount
        for a fixed-rate mortgage loan based on user-provided input such as
        loan amount, annual interest rate, and number of years to repay.

        The user can optionally generate a detailed payment schedule
        saved to a text file, which outlines the interest, principal,
        and remaining balance for each monthly payment.

        The program demonstrates class encapsulation, member functions,
        constructors/destructors, and file output operations.

    Function: main

    Programmer's Note:
        - Drives the Mortgage class functionality through user interaction.
        - Repeatedly prompts for loan details, calculates results, and offers
          the option to process additional loans.
        - Handles input clearing to prevent input stream issues.

    Simpler Terms:
        This is the main program that asks the user for loan info,
        shows the monthly payment and total payback,
        and asks if the user wants to process another loan.
